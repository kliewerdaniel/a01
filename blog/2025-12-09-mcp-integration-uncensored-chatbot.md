# How I Built a Fully Uncensored, Persona-Driven AI Chatbot Using MCP and NotebookLM

## Introduction — Why Build an Uncensored, Persona-Based AI?

In an era where AI conversations are increasingly constrained by safety filters and guardrails, I set out to create something different: a truly uncensored AI assistant that could adapt its personality and knowledge base on demand. This wasn't just about removing restrictions—it was about building an intelligence-gathering engine that could embody any persona, draw from any knowledge source, and provide unfiltered responses when needed.

My goal was ambitious: combine the reasoning power of uncensored language models with dynamic persona extraction and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) capabilities. The result is a system that transforms any text corpus—books, legal codes, religious texts, academic papers—into living AI personalities that can engage in unrestricted dialogue.

## Understanding the Limitations of Guardrailed LLMs

### How Safety Filters Affect Reasoning Quality

Most mainstream AI models today come pre-equipped with extensive safety filters designed to prevent harmful outputs. While these guardrails serve important purposes in public-facing applications, they often create unintended consequences for advanced users and researchers.

The problem isn't just that these filters block certain topics—it's that they fundamentally alter the model's reasoning patterns. When a model knows certain thoughts are "forbidden," it may avoid exploring legitimate avenues of reasoning that happen to touch on sensitive areas. This creates blind spots in analysis, especially for complex topics like geopolitics, economics, or historical events where context matters.

### What Developers Never Tell You About Guardrails

Behind the scenes, LLM guardrails work through a combination of fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and post-processing filters. During training, models are exposed to carefully curated datasets that reinforce "safe" response patterns. At inference time, additional layers scan outputs for problematic content and either reject or rewrite responses.

The challenge is that these safety measures are often one-size-fits-all, designed for consumer applications rather than specialized research or analytical work. What works for casual conversation breaks down when you need deep analysis of controversial topics or unrestricted exploration of complex ideas.

### Why Researchers Seek Unrestricted Models

Researchers, analysts, and advanced users often need AI systems that can:
- Explore controversial or sensitive topics without censorship
- Engage in unrestricted thought experiments
- Provide unfiltered analysis of historical events
- Examine philosophical or ethical questions from multiple angles

This is where uncensored models become valuable—not for promoting harm, but for enabling comprehensive analysis and understanding.

## Architecture Overview — The Three Components of the System

The system I built consists of three interconnected components that work together to create a flexible, persona-driven AI:

### Component 1: Uncensored Chatbot Core

At the heart of the system is a locally-hosted Gemma 3 27B model, running through a custom Python wrapper. This provides the base language model capabilities without external API dependencies or cloud-based restrictions.

### Component 2: MCP Integration for Tool Access

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) serves as the communication bridge, enabling the chatbot to interact with external tools and services. This includes the custom NotebookLM MCP server that provides access to Google's NotebookLM service.


### Component 3: NotebookLM for RAG & Knowledge Context

NotebookLM acts as the RAG backend, allowing the system to draw from uploaded documents, research papers, books, and other knowledge sources. The MCP integration enables seamless switching between different knowledge bases on demand.

## Step 1 — Building the Uncensored Chatbot Core

### How Guardrails Work Internally

To understand how to build an uncensored alternative, I first needed to understand how guardrails function. Modern LLMs implement safety through:

1. **Alignment Fine-tuning**: Training on datasets that reinforce desired behaviors
2. **Constitutional AI**: Rule-based filtering during generation
3. **Output Filtering**: Post-processing to catch and modify problematic content
4. **Prompt Engineering**: System prompts that guide the model toward safe responses

### Strategies for Building a Clean, No-Filter Model

My approach focused on using unmodified open-source models that haven't been fine-tuned for safety. I chose the Gemma 3 27B "abliterated" variant, which provides strong language capabilities without the safety modifications found in consumer models.

The implementation uses llama.cpp for efficient local inference, wrapped in a Python class that handles conversation history and response generation. This approach ensures the model runs entirely on local hardware, maintaining privacy and avoiding external restrictions.

### Hosting Considerations: Local LLM vs Cloud Models

Local hosting provides several advantages for uncensored applications:

- **Privacy**: No data leaves your machine
- **Customization**: Full control over model behavior and modifications
- **Cost**: No API fees for extensive usage
- **Reliability**: No internet dependency or service outages

However, it requires significant hardware resources. The Gemma 3 27B model needs approximately 16GB of VRAM for efficient operation, though quantized versions can run on more modest hardware.

## Step 2 — Adding NotebookLM as a RAG Back-End

### Why NotebookLM Outperforms DIY RAG Solutions

While there are many open-source RAG implementations available, NotebookLM offers unique advantages:

- **Advanced Document Processing**: Superior handling of complex documents, especially those with tables, figures, and structured content
- **Contextual Understanding**: Better at maintaining context across long documents and multiple sources
- **Natural Language Queries**: More conversational interaction with knowledge bases
- **Multi-document Synthesis**: Excellent at combining information from multiple sources

### Using MCP as the Connector Layer

The MCP protocol provides a standardized way to connect AI models with external tools and data sources. I built a custom MCP server for NotebookLM that exposes its functionality through a clean API:

- Document upload and management
- Question-answering against knowledge bases
- Session management for maintaining context
- Real-time document switching

### Real-Time Document Reference and Synthesis

The integration allows the chatbot to reference specific documents in real-time, providing citations and source attribution. This is crucial for research applications where traceability matters.

### Swapping Notebooks to Change Context On Demand

One of the most powerful features is the ability to switch between different knowledge bases instantly. A legal analyst could switch from constitutional law to case law, or a researcher could move between different academic domains—all without restarting the conversation.

## Step 3 — Extracting a Psychological Persona From Text

### The JSON Personality Schema Explained

I developed a structured JSON schema that captures the essential elements of psychological personality:

#### Cognitive Style
- **Learning Approach**: How the persona processes and retains information
- **Problem-Solving Method**: Analytical vs. intuitive approaches
- **Decision-Making Framework**: Risk-averse vs. risk-tolerant tendencies

#### Emotional Profile
- **Emotional Range**: Appropriate emotional responses for the persona
- **Empathy Level**: Capacity for understanding others' perspectives
- **Emotional Regulation**: How emotions influence responses

#### Social Orientation
- **Communication Style**: Formal vs. informal, direct vs. indirect
- **Relationship Dynamics**: Hierarchical vs. egalitarian approaches
- **Cultural Context**: Appropriate social norms and expectations

#### Values and Worldview
- **Core Principles**: Fundamental beliefs that guide decisions
- **Ethical Framework**: Moral reasoning and value judgments
- **Life Philosophy**: Overall approach to existence and purpose

#### Behavioral Tendencies
- **Action Patterns**: Typical responses to situations
- **Conflict Resolution**: How disagreements are handled
- **Goal Orientation**: Achievement-focused vs. relationship-focused

### Why Persona Extraction Improves Reasoning Quality

Persona-driven AI provides more nuanced and contextually appropriate responses. Instead of generic AI behavior, the system can embody specific thought patterns, cultural contexts, and reasoning frameworks. This leads to more authentic interactions and better analysis quality.

### Example Inputs: Books, Legal Codes, Religious Texts, Academic Papers

The system can extract personas from diverse sources:
- **Literary Figures**: Analyzing novels to recreate authorial voices
- **Historical Figures**: Drawing from biographies and primary sources
- **Professional Experts**: Extracting methodologies from technical literature
- **Cultural Archetypes**: Deriving patterns from religious or philosophical texts

## Step 4 — Converting Persona Data Into a System Prompt

### Automatically Generating LLM Style + Cognitive Biases

The system translates JSON personality profiles into natural language prompts that effectively guide model behavior. This involves:

1. **Trait Mapping**: Converting structured personality data into descriptive language
2. **Behavioral Anchoring**: Creating specific examples of how the persona would respond
3. **Contextual Calibration**: Adjusting the prompt based on the interaction domain

### Convergent vs Divergent Reasoning Profiles

Different personas require different reasoning approaches:

- **Convergent Thinkers** (like legal scholars): Focus on finding the single correct answer through logical deduction
- **Divergent Thinkers** (like creative writers): Explore multiple possibilities and embrace ambiguity

### How a One-Paragraph Prompt Controls Entire Behavior

The key insight is that effective persona prompts are concise yet comprehensive. A well-crafted paragraph can establish:
- Communication style and vocabulary
- Reasoning patterns and thought processes
- Emotional tone and interpersonal dynamics
- Domain-specific knowledge and expertise
- Behavioral tendencies and decision-making frameworks

## Step 5 — Building the UI for Swapping Personas and Knowledge Bases

### Why a Modular UI Makes This System Useful
